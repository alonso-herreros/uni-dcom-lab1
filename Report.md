## Signal-to-Noise ratio

As instructed, the dispersion diagram for the 16-QAM signal was created for
different SNRs, including the corresponding values of $N_0$. The results can be
found in the following figures.

Figure 1.1.1: q[n] observed at SNR = 15 dB.
</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.1.1: q[n] observed at SNR = 10 dB.
</p>

Figure 1.1.1: q[n] observed at SNR = 5 dB.

As we can observe in the figures, as the SNR decreases, the signal becomes very
hard to interpret.
